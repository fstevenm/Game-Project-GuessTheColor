## Game-Project-GuessTheColor

I have created a game using the GUI library in Python, namely tkinter. Apart from using tkinter, I also use pygame to create sound effects.

This game is a game about guessing the color of the color in a word within 30 seconds. In other words, here we are asked to guess a color, not type the displayed sentence. I made this game to assess the accuracy and focus of the players of this game. Of course, I also used some references from the internet to make this game.

#### This is the initial view of this game:
